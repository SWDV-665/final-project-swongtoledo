    <br>It is our genuine wish to match each of our animals in our program with families that are perfect for them. We want our animals and our adopters to be happy with each other forever. We try to get to know potential adopters and advise them to help them find the perfect cat for their family. <br>
    <br>
    The following is an overview of our adoption process:<br>


    Adoption Application: Provides us basic information about the potential adopter to help find a perfect match. Once submitted, a volunteer will contact you by email to set up a meet and greet. Due to high volume of inquiries, only potential adopters who we have a good fit for will be contacted, usually within 7-10 business days. 
    Meet and Greet: Conducted at the foster home or adoption event, this gives potential adopters a chance to meet and interact with interested cat(s).<br>
    <br>
    Home Delivery: If all parties (applicant, foster and rescue) agree the interested cat(s) are a good fit, the foster will bring the new cats to the applicants home to finalize the adoption paperwork on a scheduled day. This procedure helps the cats get settled in and is a chance for any last minute questions or concerns to be answered. 
    Adoption Donation Fees: Up to 6 months old: $200; 6 months â€“ 1 year: $150; 1 year or older: $125. <br>
    <br>

    Follow-up: The prior foster will follow-up once in a while with adopters to ensure all is going smoothly and assist with any problems or concerns.
